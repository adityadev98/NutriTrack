## Running the Project

### **Development Mode**
For development, run:
```sh
npm run dev
```

```sh
 npm install -g cross-env
```

To run only the frontend separately:
```sh
cd NutriTrack-Frontend
npm run dev
```

### **Production Mode (Deployment)**

```sh
npm run build
npm start
```
This:
1. Installs all necessary dependencies.
2. Builds the frontend.
3. Starts the backend in production mode.
